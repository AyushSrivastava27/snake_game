# snake_game

The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or
some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of
food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
